## Direct3D 1st Person Game UPDATE\! Frame rate limiter now working\!


</div>

### Description

I have added Direct Input support for the mouse, plus the feedback for the frame rate limiter has been added and is now WORKING!

Just replace the modMain.bas with the one in the zip.

I have only uploaded the modMain.bas file in the zip to reduce file size.

you can download the original ver from here:

Please note, i did not write the frame rate limiter or the actual direct 3d code....just the direct input code.

Frame rate limiter was written by thomas sturm.
